# Labyrint
2D game in which you play a tank.

Hobby project I created during the summer break of 2010, not under active development.

See [release.zip](release.zip) for a compiled version. To run:

 - Extract all the files in the .zip
 - Run the Labyrint.jar file
 
 There are cheat codes... check the source!
